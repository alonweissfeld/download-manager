/**
 * This class is a Runnable thread that is responsible to download a specific byte
 * range of a file from a given url.
 * It uses a Blocking Queue, to pass any downloaded data forward for the services
 * that are responsible to write this data to the actual file.
 * It downloads the range from the internet by chunks, that is, each iteration we
 * call read() we fill up a complete chunk array of bytes. The size of the array
 * is determined by the chunkSize, and the number of times we expect to read
 * data was previously calculated by it's creator and is actually the number
 * of chunks that fit in the byte range for this thread.
